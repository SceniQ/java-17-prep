		if(number instanceof Integer data && data.compareTo(5)>0)

		//The type of the pattern variable must be a subtype of the variable on the left side of the

		The switch statement is a complex decision-making structure in

		What if we have a lot of possible branches or paths for a single value? For example, we
		might want to print a different message based on the day of the week. We could certainly
		accomplish this with a combination of seven if or else statements, but Java, along with many other languages, provides a cleaner approach. In this
		section we present the switch statement
		**/
		
		//1. with Java 14, case values can now be combined:
		switch(day) {
			case 1,2: System.out.print("Lion");
			case 3: System.out.print("Tiger");
		}
		
		System.out.println();
		//Prior to Java 14, the equivalent code would have been the following:
		switch(day) {
			case 1: case 2: System.out.print("Lion");
			case 3: System.out.print("Tiger");
		}
		
		System.out.println();
		//2. One last note you should be aware of for the exam: a switch statement is not required to contain any case
		//statements. For example, this statement is perfectly valid:
		switch(day) {}
		
		System.out.println();
		//3. Going back to our printDayOfWeek() method, we can rewrite it to use a switch statement
		//instead of if/else statements:
		switch(day) {
			case 0:
			System.out.print("Sunday");
			break;
			case 1:
			System.out.print("Monday");
			break;
			case 2:
			System.out.print("Tuesday");
			break;
			case 3:
			System.out.print("Wednesday");
			break;
			case 4:
			System.out.print("Thursday");
			break;
			case 5:
			System.out.print("Friday");
			break;
			case 6:
			System.out.print("Saturday");
			break;
			default:
			System.out.print("Invalid value");
			break;
		}
		//4. Exiting with break Statements (as shown above):
		// A break statement terminates the switch statement and returns flow control to the enclosing process. Put simply, it ends the switch statement immediately.
		
		System.out.println();
		//5. Determining Acceptable Case Values
		//the values in each case statement must be compile-time constant values of the same data type as the switch value
		//you canâ€™t have a case statement value that requires executing a method at runtime, even if that method always returns the same value.
		final int bananas = 1;
		int apples = 2;
		int numberOfAnimals = 3;
		final int cookies = 0;//getCookies(); //if method exists
		switch(numberOfAnimals) {
			case bananas:
			case apples: // DOES NOT COMPILE
			//case getCookies(): // DOES NOT COMPILE
			case cookies : // DOES NOT COMPILE
			case 3 * 5 : //as expressions are allowed as case values, provided the value can be resolved at compile-time
